# Pokemon Clone 0.0.1

## Summary
This was meant to be an exploratory project into using Java AWT and Swing. My goal was to create a functioning 2D
game where the player could explore a map, find items and encounter entities that would roam about the map freely.

Currently, you can find items in 6 different locations on the map and there are 6 different entities you can interact with.
If you have the item in your inventory, you are able to initiate the battle phase where a sub window will appear on the screen
and you may choose to either catch the pokemon or run. 

There are still many more features to add, such as a pause menu, pokemon battles, movesets, etc., With more updates to come
in the future as I continue to explore Java and implement new features. 

## How to Run the Game
To run the game, either double click on the executable in **/jar_file_for_execution** or open the command prompt inside
the folder and type the following command
```
java -jar PokemonClone.jar
```

## How to Play
#### In World
WASD = Movement

Enter = Pause

#### In Battle Screen
WASD = Menu Select

Enter = Enter

To collect pokeballs simply walk over them and you will find between 1 and 3 pokeballs added to your inventory. Walk into
a pokemon with pokeballs in your inventory to encounter wild pokemon. 

Find and catch all 6 pokemon before you run out of
pokeballs to win!
